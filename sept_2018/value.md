# Value is rare

Most of the work we do falls into a very select group of buckets.

**Enjoyable:** This work is fun. It's engaging, and it gives us satisfaction that we've been productive. This is the work we seek above all else.

**Urgent:** Someone, somewhere, at some point decided that this piece of the project is on fire and everything must come to a screaming halt until this is taken care of.

**Anxious:** The antithesis of Enjoyable, this is the work we do out of self-preservation in fear of what might happen if we don't meet expectations.

More often than not, work falls into this bucket. This is the work we seek to avoid above all else.
**Not on this list: Valuable.**

We have a really hard time ranking what's valuable relative to other pieces of work. Tradeoffs are for other people, not us.

**But, ranking value based on tradeoffs is the most important exercise we can go through before deciding what to work on next.**

Most people don't consider the Valuable bucket first, resulting in work defaulting to Anxious or Urgent.

A day spent doing valuable work is rare. ***What can you do to change that?***
