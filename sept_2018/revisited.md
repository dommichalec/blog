Courage: ***Do you have what it takes to be vulnerable in an environment that values having more answers than questions?***

Focus: ***Are you focused on the work that's most valuable?***

Openness: ***Do you have what it takes to open yourself up to new challenges while being transparent about your strengths and weaknesses?***

Respect: ***Are you respectful to new perspectives and ideas that clash with your ego?***
