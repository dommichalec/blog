# "I'm here because..."

If someone can authentically finish this sentence, you want them on your team. Better yet, if what they say is elevated by their actions, you want them on your team. These are the people who become catalysts for transformation from good (or not good) to great. **These people keep value in focus.**

These people are different from those who merely ingest a mission, whether they want to or not, and move forward. These people voluntarily choose to funnel their work through a set of ideas ahead of their personal gain.

Mission-driven trumps adherence, every time.

***Why are you here?***
