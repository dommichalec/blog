# What's the fastest you can go?

As Agile professionals, we're use to answering this question. Sometimes we answer it on a week to week basis, sometimes a month to month basis.

This is a different dynamic from the questions most people deal with on a daily basis. Our professions, our careers are often seen as marathons, designed to last as long as we're able and willing to keep going.

Sprints-timeboxed segments of time with a definitive beginning and a definitive end—develop a different perspective. They help us understand our upper bound while establishing a rhythm that reminds us to incrementally re-evaluate what’s possible now and what's best suited for later down the road.

I'm not talking about sprinting haphazardly. Rather, sprinting with a goal in mind, in a deliberate direction. All while constantly re-evaluating what is needed (and not needed) today to stay on track towards that goal.

No one can sprint all the time. By its very nature, that’s not sprinting. But sprinting within the confines of time and rhythm is useful in order to inspect and adapt the trajectory and direction of what's possible.
