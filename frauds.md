# We're all frauds
Most Scrum Masters I talk to are always in a state of self-doubt. Am I doing enough for my team? Do I even know what I'm talking about? I feel like everyone knows I'm bluffing my way through this project. They're delivering on a highly-sophisticated, technical product and I don't even know where to find the command prompt on my computer.

**It's understandable.** The position is one of servant-leadership: no real authority but very real responsibility for optimizing the flow of team and product. It's a tough position to be in. But no one said it's easy.

And that's the ironic beauty of it all. **It should be hard because optimizing people and processes is hard.** It's a balancing act of logic and emotions.

As Scrum Master, you don't need to know everything. Your sole focus is on enabling those around you to solve problems. In fact, I come from a technical background and I feel like that experience actually held be back in being a successful SM. I was too involved in the what, not the who.

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Sound familiar?

If you feel like a fraud, if you feel like everyone else knows more than you... relax. Better yet, use that insecurity to focus on your team and fight the mediocrity bug you think you have.

We're all figuring this out together. The sooner you become comfortable with that admission, the better you (and your team) will be.
