# The silver bullet fallacy
**Too many people approach their work within an Agile environment thinking it's a methodology that'll solve their problems.**

Those people are also the same people who become increasingly frustrated with Agile, not seeing the gains of their implementations.

***We're doing Agile now, why aren't things improving? I thought Agile was suppose to cure the headaches we were experiencing. It's just adding to the frustrations.***

**Agile implementation doesn't solve problems. It reveals problems for you to ACT upon.** If you're bad at admitting problems, if you're bad at keeping things honest, you'll never see the benefits of using Agile.

How well are you at responding to change? How well are you at listening and putting the needs of the team above your own?

It's easy to blame a nebulous idea; it's harder to look inward and apply that idea to yourself and the work you produce.
